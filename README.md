# Drowsiness Detection System

## Overview

This project implements a **Drowsiness Detection System** that uses real-time facial feature tracking and machine learning algorithms to monitor and detect signs of drowsiness in a user. The system identifies symptoms like eye closure, yawning, and head movements, which are indicative of fatigue or sleepiness.

The project is built using **OpenCV** for real-time facial landmark detection, **TensorFlow** or **Keras** for machine learning models, and various other Python libraries for image processing and data handling.

## Features

* **Real-time Drowsiness Detection**: Continuously monitors and detects drowsiness symptoms (e.g., eye closure, yawning).
* **Audio/Visual Alerts**: Provides feedback in the form of sounds or pop-up alerts when drowsiness is detected.
* **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface or GUI (if applicable).
* **Customizable Sensitivity**: Allows tuning of drowsiness detection sensitivity levels.

## Requirements

Before running this project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (`cv2`)
* Dlib (for facial landmark detection)
* TensorFlow/Keras (for machine learning models)
* NumPy
* Matplotlib (optional, for visualizing data)
* Scikit-learn (optional, for additional models or pre-processing)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python dlib tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/drowsiness-detection.git
cd drowsiness-detection
```

## How to Run

To run the drowsiness detection system, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python drowsiness_detection.py
```

Ensure you have access to a webcam (or a camera device) connected to your computer as the system uses real-time video feeds.

### Optional: Run with GUI

If your project includes a graphical user interface (GUI), you can run it using:

```bash
python drowsiness_detection_gui.py
```

## Functionality

* **Webcam Feed**: The system captures video from your webcam and processes it in real time.
* **Detection Algorithm**: Detects faces and tracks key facial landmarks (such as eyes and mouth). Based on eye closure rates, mouth opening, and head position, the system assesses if the user is drowsy.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve this project, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Ensure that your contributions adhere to the following guidelines:

* Follow PEP 8 for Python code style.
* Ensure the system is well-documented.
* Test all code changes thoroughly.

### Report Bugs or Issues
